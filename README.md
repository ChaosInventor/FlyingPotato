# FlyingPotato

This is an old game I made back in 2018 that has since been pulled from the
playstore due to policy changes and me not being bothered to do anything about
it. Feel free to do whatever you want with these assets, they're all GPL'ed,
excluding the API bindings, those aren't mine.

I've also removed all external google dependencies since I'm no sure if those
contain sensitive secrets, just to make sure.

You can find the original APK, `Flying potato.apk`, in the repo's root.

This repository will be archived, I don't intend to continue this project's
development.
